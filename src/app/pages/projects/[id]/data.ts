      This is a project for an Australian client where we were tasked to create sort of social network for the construction industry in Australia.
      It has different features such as constructor profile, constructor search, constructor networking, and more.   
      This project further tested my skills as a developer as I was given more responsibility than my previous professional projects. \n
      As I joined in the middle of the development of the system, I had to scan the source code in order to follow existing coding patterns and 
      naming conventions in order to efficiently fit in the development process. I was deeply involved in code reviews as I wanted to learn more from colleagues. 
      This helped my habit of continuous learning. I was also in charge of implementing the mobile design.\n
      I was given a huge responsibility to create and implement all components for the networking feature of the website, from design to usable interface. 
      This involved multiple screens, creation of components from scratch, adjusting existing components to make them re-usable, and of course, the 
      implementation of the respective API endpoints into the frontend. \n
      For this project, I was 90% on the frontend development, with 10% on the backend for minor modifications as there was a dedicated backend developer.

      I was able to further develop my learnings and skills with React as it produced its own unique set of challenges compared to previous projects;   \
      And not just my usage of React was developed, but my skills in writing cleaner code were tested too as it was needed for reusability and scale.   \
